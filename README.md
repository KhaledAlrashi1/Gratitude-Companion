## Overview
Gratitude Companion is a friendly and supportive chatbot designed to help users practice gratitude. The chatbot encourages users to think about the positive aspects of their lives and helps them build a habit of gratitude through thought-provoking questions and friendly interactions.


## Backgorund
For some time, I’ve been practicing gratitude daily, and it has been life-transformative. However, I often struggle to find new things to write about. I realized that asking unique questions could help uncover overlooked aspects of my life. So, I started using LLMs like Groq and ChatGPT to generate thought-provoking questions, leading to more meaningful gratitude sessions.

Gratitude Companion is a chatbot designed to enhance your gratitude practice by asking engaging questions. It integrates the recently developed GPT-4o mini for better text processing and understanding. What sets it apart is its training on online blogs shared by people, turning relevant blog content into live conversations. This allows users to share important memories and experiences, creating a sense of connection and realizing the commonality of human experiences.

Why should we practice gratitude? It helps us see the positive aspects of life, reminds us what’s truly important, encourages us to live in the present moment, reduces social comparison, and strengthens our relationships.
